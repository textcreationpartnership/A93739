            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For if <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> had only ſpoken thoſe Words unto the few <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then preſent with them, but had never Written them, they would have been like <hi>A Voice Crying in the Wilderneſs,</hi> which is emphatically remarked concerning <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> by <hi>Eſaias</hi> in <hi>Mat. 3. 3.</hi> for <hi>John</hi> ſpake four or five Sentences, which are there <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded</hi> and <hi>Written</hi> for him by the <hi>Evangeliſt:</hi> But he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Writing nothing hereof, was as a Voice of one <hi>crying in the Wilderneſs,</hi> which we know inſtantly periſhes in the utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſeems as nothing afterwards.

            <p>I have one thing more to Admoniſh the People of this my Generation and Countrey of, and to exhort them unto, which doth concern them all. <hi>Say I theſe things as a Man,</hi> for <hi>doth not the Law and the Goſpel ſay the very ſame?</hi> for it was the Requiring of God of old time, <hi>Who is the ſame to day, yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, and for ever;</hi> That none ſhould appear Empty before the Lord. But every one was to do ſomewhat according to his Ability, They that could not go to the price of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> were to bring a pair of <hi>Turtle Doves,</hi> or two young <hi>Pigeons.</hi> And by what is written in the Goſpel of her who <hi>Caſt in her. Mite</hi> (whereof two make a <hi>Farthing) into the Offerings of God.</hi> By this it appears that even day <hi>Labourers</hi> and <hi>Vine Dreſſers,</hi> yea the pooreſt of the People, <hi>ſhould not ſerve God with that which coſt them nothing,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 24. But it is expected from them, <hi>that even they ſhould Honour the Lord with their Subſtance</hi> (for he is to be ſerved, by all that is within and without us, even with the Fruits of our Labour) and <hi>conſecrate their Gain unto the Lord, and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance unto the Lord of the whole Earth,</hi> Mich. 4. 13. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the Publiſhing and Propagation of his Eternal Truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Power and Abillity. <hi>For, if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is yet more eſpecially required and expected from them that are Rich in this World; for the Goſpel (and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable will be the end of thoſe who ſhall not obey the Goſpel) doth <hi>Charge them that they be Rich in good Works, ready to Diſtribute, willing to Communicate.

               </gap>rtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to their Ability, be ready to diſtribute for the Service and Propagation of his Eternal Truth. If they would buy good and Godly Books, and give them to Poor People, laying an Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them, and having a Promiſe from them to read and conſider throughly of the things contained therein; This would be the beſt kind of Charity, for this would be a doing good to their Immortal Souls: Whereas Common and Outward <hi>Alms</hi> is only a Temporal kindneſs unto the dying Body. As it is Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Be not thou Afraid when one is made Rich, when the Glory of his Houſe is Increaſed, for when he dieth, he ſhall carry nothing away; his Glory ſhall not deſcend after him.</hi> So it is ſenſibly ſeen that Rich People do Sicken and die all one as the Poor and Needy; And then they will find, <hi>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was this Waſte?</hi> For that ſame Money which they expended in fine Cloaths, Gayety or Retinue, in making a Figure in the World <hi>(as a Dream when one awaketh, ſo O Lord when thou awakeſt, thou ſhalt deſpiſe their Image)</hi> in Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, which is making proviſion for the Fleſh to fulfil the Luſts thereof, in Pride Pleaſure, Prodigality, Gaming, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain things, This might have been given to the Poor, or it might have been Expended in <hi>making known thy Truth,</hi> Iſa. 38. 19. which ſeems to be the beſt of Works for the Reaſon afore-mentioned; and then it would have done themſelves more good, and have ſtood them in more ſtead then the <hi>Riches they uſed to the hurt of the owners.</hi>

            <p>If the Rich People have not heretofore, or ſhall not hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (that day is coming on and haſtning when, <hi>even the Rich among the People ſhall intreat thy Favour,</hi> Pſal. 45. 12.) Obey and do according to this Exhortation and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The word of God doth find them out, and this cometh to paſs becauſe of what is Written, <hi>There is an Evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, and it is common among Men. A Man to whom God hath given Riches, Wealth and Honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing for his Soul of all that he deſireth,
<pb facs="tcp:151375:6"/> yet God giveth him not Power to Eat thereof, but a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger eateth it, this is Vanity and an Evil Diſeaſe.</hi> Even ſo God giveth not to ſuch <hi>Power</hi> or an <hi>Heart (O that there were an Heart in them to fear me,</hi> ſaith God, And, <hi>Wherefore is there a Price put in the Hand of a Fool to get Wiſdom, and he hath no Heart to it?)</hi> either to give unto the Poor, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate their Gain and Subſtance unto the Lord, by Expending it for the Service of his Truth. But as our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, ſpeaketh Pertinently, Properly, and truly when he twice in the ſame Chapter calleth it the <hi>Mammon of Unrighteouſneſs, the Unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Luke 16. 9. 11. In the Margent oppoſite to <hi>Mammon</hi> in both places, it is <hi>Riches,</hi> for they are moſt commonly gotten by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous means, <hi>viz. By ſuch means as are contrary unto or different from that Great and Compleat Rule of Righteouſneſs in Scripture.</hi> Even ſo again it is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, <hi>That what is got by Unrighteous and Sinful means, is likewiſe ſpent in Unrighteous and Sinful ways;</hi> as ſuch are thoſe aforementioned. And therefore they hate the <hi>Light and the Truth,</hi> which would manifeſt and reprove their Evil ways; For the ſame reaſon they are Rebellious againſt it, and would not have it come forth. According to that other true ſaying of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>And this is the Condemnation that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Light, becauſe their Deeds were Evil, for every one that doeth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leaſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> In the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent it is diſcovered, <hi>But he that doeth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.</hi> But when the Lord cometh after a long time (which yet will certainly come at Death and Judgment) and reckoneth with thoſe Servants for this Talent committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and intruſted with them, then it will be ſeen and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what way will be found beſt to have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſed or Employed the ſame, or by ſinful Covetouſneſs, to have the ruſt of their Silver and Gold be a Witneſs againſt them, and <hi>to have heaped up Treaſure together for the laſt days,</hi> James 5. 3.</p>
            <p>As for mine own part I have put my ſelf to Difficulties, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages and Loſs, as to my Worldly Subſtance, <hi>for to my Power (I bear Record) yea and beyond my Power I was
<pb facs="tcp:151375:7"/> willing that the following Words may ſee Light, and that theſe Children which are come to the Birth may be brought forth.</hi> But to allude unto <hi>2 Cor. 8. 13, 14.</hi> This might be eaſed by an Equality, that now at this time their abundance may be a ſupply for my want; I mean by the Charitable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Chriſtian People, who receive the Truth in the love thereof. For this work of the Lord is common, and ſhould be the joynt Endeavour of all his Servants, <hi>For thy Servants take pleaſure in her Stones, and Favour the Duſt thereof,</hi> Pſal. 102. 14. which is the leaſt thing belonging to it. So then they ſhould help and forward every leaſt thing that tends to the building up of <hi>Zion:</hi> As the certainty of the words of Truth doth build up the People of God (which is Spiritually <hi>Zion)</hi> in their moſt Holy Faith, and towards making <hi>them a People prepared for the Lord.</hi> Whether it will be ſo or not according to the Intimation here given; However I hope and truſt that Almighty God will be pleaſed to pardon mine Ignorance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and Graciouſly accept of theſe my Labours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in making known his Truth.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollos may wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but God gives the increaſe,</hi> therefore I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord-Jeſus-Chriſt, Humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to give his Bleſſing unto, and accompany with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what is hereafter written, that they may appear to be <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, even words of Truth;</hi> And that they may be <hi>as nails faſtened by the Maſters of Aſſemblies, which are given from one Shepherd.</hi>

                  <p>Then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> turned his Face toward the Wall and Prayed unto the Lord; And ſaid, Remember now O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a Perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wept ſore.</p>

            <p>I Have Written and Preached, and <hi>(Bleſſed be God moſt high that performeth all things for me)</hi> have cauſed to be Printed and Publiſhed, <hi>(This ſhall be Written for the Generation to come; and the People which ſhall be Created ſhall Praiſe the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 102. 18.) Six ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sermons or Diſcourſes on the foregoing Verſe. Now the Order, Method and Courſe of our Miniſtry, requires to ſpeak ſome things from the words above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>In the ſhutting up and concluſion of that Book it was ſaid, that all the Sermons and Preaching in the World, if they be rightly and truly managed, were all to the very ſame end and purpoſe, To inſtruct and exhort us, <hi>To ſet our Souls in order for we ſhall die;</hi> Or that they may be <hi>ſet in order</hi> (which was explained to be in a readineſs, and that nothing be wanting in them) againſt the time they ſhall go out of theſe Bodies. We do hence ſee what is to be done then, when that time comes. So that by thoſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151375:8"/> words we are Inſtructed how to die, or how to behave, fit and prepare our ſelves a little before, and as we come to die. But now in the Words which I have here choſen for my Text, we are taught what we muſt do throughout all our Life. So that in the three firſt Verſes of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chapter, we are informed and directed how to live and how to die; What we muſt do in our life time, and what in the Day of Sickneſs and of Death: And what would Man have more in order to his ſalvation, Security and Happineſs, then to know how to live and how to die. Truly, there cannot be more deſired then theſe two things, For herein is Compriſed the whole State of his Duration, both in this World and alſo in his Paſſage into the next. for inaſmuch as the Spirit ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead that die in the Lord,</hi> Rev. 14. 13. We may aſſuredly gather, that they who live well (as ſuch do who live unto the Lord) will alſo die well, and will die in the Lord. Again, they that die well, or who die in the Lord, will be bleſſed for evermore, even ſo as to receive, partake of and Inherit that <hi>Bleſſing which the Lord hath Commanded, even Life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 133. 3.</p>
            <p>When I firſt entred upon my Miniſtry, I promiſed unto my Hearers, that I would inſiſt only upon uſeful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Subjects, which I have obſerved accordingly, and yet more chiefly when I have ſpoken of theſe things. I do hereby appeal to the ſeveral Hearts and Conſciences of thoſe who ſhall Hear or Read this, Can ye think of a more profitable and uſeful Subject of Diſcourſe then for ye to be put in mind and directed, how ye ought to live, and how ye ought to die?</p>
            <p>The Words of our Text, are <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Prayer and Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Lord, in the preſence and hearing of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which may be ſuppoſed by way of Anſwer to that meſſage and ſaying of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> from the Lord unto him, which was, <hi>Set thine Houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live;</hi> And thereupon this behaviour and reply of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> is thus recorded, <hi>Then</hi> Hezekiah <hi>turned his Face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now what God ſpake in time paſt unto <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by the Prophet, in theſe laſt Days he doth ſpeak the ſame unto each Man or Woman, in his word and by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151375:8"/> thereof, all one, as if he now called them ſeverally by their Names, ſuch an one and ſuch an one, yea, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of ye, <hi>Set thine Houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain, That every one cannot make ſo Good an Anſwer and Return hereupon as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did; for as all <hi>are Tranſgreſſours from the Womb,</hi> ſo the greater part of Men and Women do continue ſo. But to make ſuch a comfortable Anſwer and Return, is only the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lot,</hi> and Portion of the <hi>Generation of thy Children,</hi> the true Saints and Servants of the Lord.</p>
            <p>There is a wide difference between ſudden wiſhes and real continued performances: For the firſt, even Sinners and Hypocrites, the Ignorant and Ungodly have ſome times good wiſhes and wouldings towards God. O that they did pleaſe him and were at Peace with him, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do not go about ſo to do and obtain it. But the Righteous and Godly know it is vain and deceitful work before the Lord; <hi>(Curſed is He, that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully)</hi> Unleſs their Good Reſolutions be turned into actual performances. For even a wicked <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> could and did cry out before hand upon a ſerious Fit and Mood, <hi>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my laſt end be like his,</hi> Numbers 23. 10. When yet for all this Good Expreſſion, he did ſoon after <hi>Love the Wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 15. Even ſo there are in the Wicked and Children of Diſobedience, ſome ſecret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts, that it would be better for them if they did lead a Godly, Obedient and Righteous Life; But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe Good Thoughts, <hi>Like the Dog they return to their Vomit;</hi> and ſo they continue and perſiſt ſtill in their former Ungodlineſs and Irreligion, Sin and Tranſgreſſion. But it is only a Godly <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or one like unto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who can make that moſt ſweet and comfortable Review, and Appeal to him that is Inviſible, and have their own Heart and Conſcience within them, Witneſſing to the Truth, Reality and Sincerity thereof, <hi>Remember now O Lord I beſeech thee, how I have walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in Truth and with a Perfect Heart, and have done that which is Good in thy ſight, and</hi> Hezekiah <hi>wept ſore.</hi> Not for Grief and Vexation that he had done ſo. In no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151375:9"/> wiſe; but through that abundance of Comfort and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, which upon this very ſame Reflection did hence ſtream and flow in upon his Soul. For I trow and aſſure ye, that ſuch a Reflection or Remembrance is better, and will contribute more to ones future, which indeed, is the only real and enduring Happineſs; <hi>Then to have lived in Pleaſure on the Earth, to have been wanton, or to have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed our hearts as in the Day of Slaughter,</hi> James 5. 5. For it may be ſenſibly perceived even now, that the Pleaſures of this life (However, ſweet they may ſeem to ſome in Enjoyment and whilſt they were preſent; yet as they choke the word, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. So they make Death bitter and more terrible. When a Man comes to die, if he hath heretofore lived in all the Pleaſures, Riches and Honour of this World, he is never the better for having had them; but rather he ſuſpects his condition to be the worſe, in that they have occaſioned ſo much the more Sin and Guilt, and Pride unto him, as to which, he muſt go away to give an Account; and this <hi>Account will be with Grief and not with Joy, which will be unprofitable for him;</hi> He being then to undergo ſo much Pain, Loſs and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the ſin which he Committed in the Days of Fleſh. And then alſo the Soul, makes inquiry what his Good ſhe hath done in order unto, or towards God; and as from the other ſort doth ariſe <hi>fearful Expectation,</hi> ſo the having done Good will ſtand in ſome ſtead, and yield Comfort and Hope, and Aſſurance and Boldneſs in that Day. The only want and failure here will be, if there hath been any Good done, would God there had been more of it and it had been better, but that cannot be now neither, for care ſhould have been taken as to this ſooner and before; However, the Soul muſt go away to give Account and receive for it as it is.</p>
            <p>It is probable by theſe two kinds of Speech, <hi>Hezekiah was ſick unto Death, then</hi> Hezekiah <hi>turned his Face towards the Wall,</hi> That <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was at this very time, when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> came unto him and ſaid thus, that then he was lying in his Bed of Sickneſs and Languiſhing; As yet more fully appears by what is after Written, <hi>When he had been ſick and was recovered of his ſickneſs,</hi> ver. 9. And then afterwards, mention is made of his <hi>Going up to the

And as it is elſwhere Written, <hi>The Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the Bed of Languiſhing; Thou wilt make all his Bed in his Sickneſs,</hi> Pſal. 41. 3. Now theſe things are Written in the Book of the Lord, for our Hope and Comfort, for our Learning and Admonition, that we ſhould alſo ſometimes in thought and ſuppoſal, throw our ſelves before hand upon a Sick and Dying Bed. That is, put the caſe and imagine it ſo to our ſelves, before we come to lye upon it in Deed and Reality; For we ſhall never be the ſooner ſick in Conceit for thus doing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereby we may be the better ſtrengthened in the Soul, and Inner Man againſt and at the very time, when our outward Body ſhall be actually Languiſhing in the Bed.</p>
            <p>For to this agree, two alike Speeches of the Antient Heathen <hi>Pliny,</hi> which are near to the ſame purpoſe and ſignification. The one whereof is, <hi>This is the ſum of all Philoſophy</hi> (which was given to regulate and make better the manners of Men) <hi>If we would be ſo in our Health, as we profeſs and reſolve we will be when we are ſick.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaying is a little further improved, <hi>This is the Sum and Height of Wiſdom, if we would do thoſe things whilſt living, which we ſhall wiſh we had done when we come to die.</hi> Now if with theſe two ſayings, we take in alſo the Knowledge of God, conſidering our Subjection and Duty to him that is Inviſible, as alſo with the <hi>Grace and Truth that came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In that <hi>Revelation</hi> which God made unto mankind by and through him, which ſpeak of things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs, which pertain to the Kingdom of God and alſo to us Men, both as to what we are now, and what we ſhall be. Let there be but the full aſſurance of Faith concerning theſe things, and what kind of thoughts will then naturally and neceſſarily ſpring up in the Soul, juſt as that is Gaſping, and ſhe is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Body even quite contrary unto, and vaſtly different from what we had whilſt in the midſt of Life, Health, Strength and Vigour. For then we were, if not wholly and only, yet chiefly and Principally taken up with and buſied about Worldly and Viſible things. But do but throughly conceive thy ſelf to be once a dying,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151375:10"/> then the <hi>Mind will be upon thè Inviſible Things of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World,</hi> whereinto the <hi>Soul</hi> is juſt going. If you do but hold out a Bag of Money, or even neceſſary and wholeſome Food, to a man, when he juſt Lies at the Point of Death: If he hath any Thoughts or Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions at all, they are quite of another and different Kind than what he had formerly concerning the ſame. For however he did formerly ſeek after them both, yet now he hath no Appetite or Deſire after the one, nor ſtomach after the other. But there doth ariſe an Antipathy and Loathing of them both; or rather a <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that now his breath is going forth, <hi>there is no help in them;</hi> for they <hi>cannot hold it in beyond the Appointed Time;</hi> and now the Time, yea the <hi>Set-Time</hi> is come, they cannot continue Being, much <hi>leſs can they give an Happy Being. Their Silver and their Gold ſhall not be able to deliver them in the day of the Wrath of the Lord: They ſhall not ſatisfy their Souls, nor fill their Bowels, becauſe it is the ſtumbling block of their Iniquity,</hi> Ezek. 7. 19. The ſame doth now appear as to <hi>all our paſt foregoing Life,</hi> whether it be Twenty, Thirty or Forty Years; ſo it will be as to thoſe who ſhall arrive at Threeſcore and Ten, or Fourſcore, or Ninety Years; It is all but <hi>as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday. when it is paſt, and as a Watch in the Night, Pſal.</hi> 90. 4. Nay, it is not <hi>all</hi> than ſo much as a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour, or one minute that is to come: <hi>We ſpend our Years as a Tale that is told.</hi> For it ſeems all one then. And ſo it being evident, <hi>that the World is then paſſed away, and all the things thereof</hi> as to us, of conſequence, as we know and find this; we muſt have but <hi>little Regard, Thought, or Deſire after them.</hi> Like as when one is Riding Poſt, and at full Speed upon the Road, how little doth he mind ſuch a ſingle Tree, or Little Buſh that ſtands by the way-ſide? for perhaps we juſt ſee it as we paſs by, but we ſoon forget, and not think upon it: Even ſo we are <hi>paſſing through this world.</hi> Vpon <hi>the Souls Diſſolution,</hi> or <hi>flight from the Body,</hi> the Lightning which moves from Eaſt to VVeſt, in the Twinkling of an Eye, is not quicker in its motion, as appears by the Quickneſs of Thought now, and by ſight, the <hi>Principal Senſe and Operation of our Soul.</hi>

As we are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up our feet in the Bed, in order to yield up the Ghoſt: How will the Spirit within gather up it ſelf and make towards the <hi>Father of Spirits?</hi> What would ſhe then give to have Peace towards God, or a God reconciled and in favour with her, and for an aſſurance, that now ſhe is to be diſlodged from this Tabernacle of Clay, ſhe may be received into <hi>Abrahams Boſom,</hi> or that ſhe might ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Into thy hands I commit my Spirit, for thou haſt redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, O Lord God of Truth,</hi> Pſal. 31. 5. It is not ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt made me, but thou haſt redeemed me.</hi> From which again it appears, they being added by way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and conſequent Reaſon thereof, that there is no commending our Spirits into the Hands of God when we come to dye and to give up the Ghoſt, without God hath firſt redeemed us by his truth.

            <p>But <hi>let no Stranger meddle with this joy;</hi> let not thoſe who are <hi>Aliens to the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, and not in Covenant with God, ever think to receive or to come in for to ſhare and partake of theſe Good and Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things: For as before obſerv'd, there is no commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Spirits when we come to dye) into the Hands of God, without having been Redeemed by him from Sin and Guilt, from the vain Converſation and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the World, from Satan and his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So it is here, in <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. Take them all together, there is no Agreement or Peace to be made with the Lord (no, not with thoſe Great, Many and Near Offers and Overtures there mentioned) without follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is good, and obeying the Requirings of the Lord, in <hi>doing juſtly, and loving Mercy, and walking Humbly with thy God,</hi> throughout thy paſt and foregoing Life. There is no other way under Heaven, to get the ſin of our Soul pardoned or taken away, or to make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or Expectation for it, but to come into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and not to break it again, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, according to what is written: <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the Day that I took them by the Hand, to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>which Covenant they brake, although I was an Husband unto them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> (This confirms the Truth of what was before ſpoken.) <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe Days ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People. And they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, know ye the Lord, for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their Iniquity, and will remember their Sin no more,</hi> Jer. 34. 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:151375:12"/>
            <p>From all this conſidered together (for a Covenant muſt be taken all together, as it lies in the whole, and not by Peace-meals) it appears, that the only way for God to forgive our Iniquity, and remember our Sin no more, is to be in covenant with God, to take him for our God. Wherein is ſuppoſed, that he is to be our Ruler and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and we his People; which implies Subjection and Obedience, to have his Law in our inward Parts, and written in our Hearts. For what end and purpoſe is that? Namely, for us to obſerve, keep and do it. So that the ready and compendious way (there is none beſides it) to obtain Forgiveneſs of Sins, and an Inheritance amongſt them that are Sanctified, is by Repentance for the paſt, and Obedience for the future. There is no other way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven given unto Men, whereby they muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: To this do all the Scriptures, both Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt and Apoſtles give witneſs. If the God of Truth hath Redeemed us, and Delivered us from the Hand of our Enemies, it is, <hi>that we might ſerve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the Days of our Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this Doctrine is pertinent, and direct to our Text; for it was this which gave <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing that did ſpring up even through his Weeping and Tears, when the Meſſage of Death was brought unto him, that before that, <hi>he had walked before God in Truth, and with a Perfect Heart. and had done that which was good in his Sight.</hi> For there is no Dying in the Lord, without having Lived unto the Lord: There is no dying the Death of the Righteous, without having lived the Life of the Righteous.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem a ſtrange thing, but only it ſhews forth the exceeding Deluſion and Subtilty of Satan, that one may ſpeak many of the Truths of God, and yet not be ſaved by them himſelf; that one may Preach unto others, and yet Himſelf be a Caſt-away; and Propheſie in Chriſt's Name, and yet at the laſt Day be rejected and diſowned by Chriſt. So <hi>Balaam</hi> could, and did really wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die the Death of the Righteous: And when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſaith, <hi>Behold, I have received Commandment to Bleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151375:12"/> 23. 20. Hereupon his own Reaſon (for the like Reaſoning and Truth runs throughout all the things of God) might have told and acquainted him, that it is impoſſible to dye the Death of the Righteous, without having lived the Life of the Righteous; for of neceſſity ſuch an one muſt have been Righteous before, which doth reſpect ſome, yea, and the moſt conſiderable part of his foregoing Life, for otherwiſe ſuch an one could not properly and truly be ſaid to be Righteous; inaſmuch as the Denomination is taken from the greater Part.

Such muſt have been Righteous before their Death; for otherwiſe the Spirit which always ſpeaks properly and truly, would not have called them <hi>Righteous.</hi> None elſe have Hope in their Death. Not all the Miniſters and People on the Earth, can ever reverſe, alter or change this ſame Order, Decree and Purpoſe of God. Now here is the ſtrange thing (which rather ſhews that Satan acted in <hi>Balaam</hi> as to that) that when <hi>Balaam</hi> knew this before, and how deſirable indeed it was to dye the Death of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, yet that he ſhould preſently hereupon <hi>love the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> which he might conclude would cut him off, and hinder him from the other good and deſirable thing. But truly Satan deceiveth not only the Poor and Fooliſh, but even the more Wiſe and Learned, and Eloquent of Mankind, for ſo was this <hi>Balaam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo as <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> could ſpeak in the Perſon of his Maſter, for <hi>thus ſaith the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>Make an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with me by a Preſent, and come out to me.</hi> Iſa. 36. 16.

            <p>There is no way to be Bleſſed in ones Death, but to be Godly in ones Life.

            <p>Theſe are Truths of great importance, and neceſſary to be Underſtood aright, and done accordingly, that Souls may no longer Shipwrack and be loſt upon thoſe deceitful and broken Planks: As if it were then ſoon enough to ſerve God throughly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and Univerſally when they come to be Sick, or in Declining and Old Age, or upon a Dying Bed.

                  </gap> Reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> This Scripture is very pertinent and proper to ſuch an occaſion: Herein this Miniſter (who probably now is a Partaker of the Truth of the former Verſe, he being at this time gone off from the Stage of the Earth) ſhewed himſelf a Workman approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, <hi>Dividing the Word of Truth aright, and giving to every one his Portion.</hi> And indeed, any one that rightly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151375:15"/> knows and underſtands the things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, doth alſo find, that the whole Deſign, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Drift and Tendency, of all that is Written in the whole Scripture, ſtands on this wiſe, <hi>They that have done Good, ſhall come forth unto the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil, unto the Reſurrection of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> John 5. 29. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the Body, according to that he hath done, whither it be Good or Bad.</hi> So that only a Godly Righteous and Sober Life, and Good Deeds will avail and ſtand in ſtead in a dying Day.</p>
            <p>For tho' the common deceit, which each Man hath in the deep of his heart (which alſo is intimated to them to their own Danger and Loſs, by thoſe who take upon them the Office of Preaching Repentance and Remiſſion of ſins) that People may turn from their Iniquities ſome time hereafter, a little before their Death. That they may have the Pleaſures of ſin for a Seaſon, the expediency of Tranſgreſſion, the Profit and Wages of unrighteouſneſs in the mean while, and then leave them off juſt ſoon enough to obtain Pardon. But certainly, this is quite to leave the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, to go backwards to Imperfection, not laying again but utterly overthrowing, yea, and contradicting the Foundation of <hi>Repentance from Dead Works;</hi> for theſe ſhould be utterly forſaken, and Fruits ſhould be brought forth Meet for Repentance. And yet further, this would make void both Law and Goſpel; for they require that, <hi>We obſerve to do his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgments all the Days that we live upon the Earth,</hi> Deut. 12. 1. <hi>That we ſerve God without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the Days of our Life,</hi> Luke 1. 74, 75. And however, it ſhall be diſtributed unto the other ſort as to Acceptation or Pardon, yet ſurely, I know it ſhall be better with them that fear God, which fear before him and turned from their Iniquities and kept his Commandments in thoſe Days of their fleſh, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers continued in Sin and Diſobedience. <hi>In the latter Days ye ſhall conſider it perfectly,</hi> Jer. 23. 20. This <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſaid, when he immediately ſpeaks thereupon of thoſe Prophets, <hi>Which Ran and Propheſied, when God had not ſpoken
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151375:16"/> unto nor ſent them; and they did not turn People from their Evil way, and from the Evil of their doings.</hi> Whereby may be ſeen that if this effect doth not follow alſo, they are no Miniſters of Gods ordaining, altho' they do take upon them the office and continue in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof, after the Law and Commandment, the Ordinances and Inſtitutions of Men. But in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Days (when their time of Tryal is over) they ſhall conſider it perfectly; and when they come to ſee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and each Man have his own reward proportioned and adjuſted according to his works and obedience; Then that which themſelves ſhall miſs and come ſhort off, will raiſe bitter anguiſh within themſelves and make to loath thoſe Shepherds. <hi>(See Zech.</hi> 11. 8.) Which ſhould have Inſtructed and Guided them otherwiſe. For this is certain on the right and ſafer ſide, that the ſooner any one comes to Repentance, and <hi>brings forth Fruits Meet for Repentance and abounds in Good Works;</hi> God is now the better pleaſed with that Man or Woman, and He will give to ſuch a more full reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Conceive your ſelves before-hand, and whilſt in Health let us in ſerious thought throw our ſelves upon a Dying Bed, juſt gaſping and breathing out our very laſt; and then think what Temper and Diſpoſition of Soul we ſhould be in, if we were in this Hour brought to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or to the Fire for our Life to be taken off from the Earth in a violent manner. Here it may be either for the Sins of others, as Jeſus was hanged on the Croſs; and ſo it is of all true Martyrs and Sufferers, it is not ſo much their own Sins, as the Sins of their Perſecutors, which put them to Death. But if any one ſuffers as a Murderer, or Robber, or an Evil Doer, againſt which, there is ſome Law of God alſo, then he ſuffers for, and dies in his own Sin. Or if one is killed by another, then it is the Sin of the Murderer which brings him unto Death. But however it be, a Dying Hour will come upon all one time or another; and then if they have any remembrance or underſtanding, Ask now of the Generations that were before thee, and did you ever hear of any one that could then ſay ſeriouſly and throughly, <hi>It is vain to ſerve God,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151375:16"/> and what Profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Doth it not then rather ſeem on the other hand, <hi>It was vain that we have not ſerved God more.</hi> The Godly and Righteous make ſuch a Reflexion and looking back, and the Wicked find it is vain, becauſe they did not ſerve God at all, or not ſo much as can be properly called ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God; for now they experimentally find all other things to be vain. When the end thereof is come, we are then throughly ſenſible of what is written, <hi>Remember how ſhort my Time is, Wherefore haſt thou made all Men in vain,</hi> Pſal. 89. 47. Therefore only it is that we have no more profit, becauſe we have not yet better kept the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord; for the more we do that, the more Profit or future Reward we ſhall receive; whereof we ſhall perceive ſomewhat more, as we come near to the end of our Hope, the Day of Death, which is indeed to the Children and Servants of God, the Birth-Day of Immortality. Therefore only it is, that we have not more Profit, becauſe we did not ſo much as we ſhould, <hi>walk Mournfully;</hi> but we ſhould have walked yet more cloſely before the Lord of Hoſts. To <hi>walk Mournfully,</hi> is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Reproach and manner of Speech of the People of the World; for they imagine and ſay, as if Religion and the Service of God, was a Melancholly and Irkſome thing; whereas if it be True and Univerſal, Inward and Real, it is the greateſt ſatisfaction and Peace to the Soul of Man, of any thing in this World.</p>
            <p>In a Dying Hour, when all things fail and ſlip from us. God and Religion are the only Reſort. <hi>My Soul cleaveth faſt unto thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt by the Spirit. But though hardly ever any one in a dying Condition did ſay, <hi>that it would have been vain for them to have ſerved God;</hi> we have heard of Thouſands ſad Examples on the other Hand, crying out upon their Death-beds of the Miſery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Sin, with Anguiſh, Bitterneſs and Vexation of Spirit, that ever they themſelves ſhould give way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and really and ſincerely then wiſhing, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had lived otherwiſe. Then they confeſs and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it was an evil and bitter thing to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Lord, and that his Fear was not in them. <hi>And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151375:17"/> they have not cried unto me with their Heart, when they howled upon their Beds,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 14. That is, upon their Sick and Dying Beds. By the Phraſe of <hi>Howling,</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth ſeem to allude unto that kind of Noiſe which Dogs uſually make when they are in Pain and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; the Senſe or Smart whereof makes them to <hi>Howl,</hi> when they have no Reaſon of Soul to comfort and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the other. Even ſo the Sinners and Hypocrites, when they are under violent Pains of Body, or the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of Pining Sickneſs, and yet much more from that fearful Expectation of thoſe dreadful things of the Inviſible World, all this will ſometimes make them cry out and howl; and yet at the ſame time they do not cry out with their Heart to God; for that hath been a long time at enmity and diſtance from him; and indeed they are ignorant and unacquainted with him.</p>
            <p>In a Dying Hour things will appear in a juſt and real value, and then will be diſcerned what was beſt to have been done: <hi>Then ſhall ye return and diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked; between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi> In the latter Days ye ſhall conſider it perfectly. It is certain that we muſt give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all, and the ſeveral Talents which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as Knowledge, Health, Riches, Time and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Now to inſtance in this laſt, which is moſt proper, becauſe we are here ſpeaking of a Dying Hour: When Time is ended, and ſhall be no more, which do you think will tend to better Reckoning, when we come to give an Account for ſo many Days and Hours ſpent.</p>
            <p>Either ſo many Days or Hours were ſpent in Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Reading, or Meditating on the Word of God, <hi>in his Law doth he meditate Day and Night,</hi> Pſal. 1. 2.</p>

            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:151375:17"/>
            <p>All theſe will turn to Good and Profitable Accounts, that <hi>we may find Mercy, Comfort and Reward from the Lord in that Day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 18.</p>
            <p>But then comes in alſo the Account which ſome muſt be forced to make on the other and worſe Hand.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> So many Hours expended in ſerving of <hi>Mammon,</hi> Covetouſneſs, and getting of unjuſt Gain.</p>
            <p>All theſe and ſuch like, will tend to Loſs and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that Day.</p>

Which time is haſtening upon them, as it hath been already fulfilled as to thoſe of foregoing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, as to the Rich and Chief of the People. <hi>As a Dream when one awaketh, ſo O Lord, when thou awakeſt, thou ſhalt deſpiſe their Image,</hi> Pſal. 73. 20. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed it, to ſtain the Pride of all Glory, and to bring into Contempt all the Honourable of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 23. 9. When Pride will profit them nothing, but rather ſink them down into the lowermoſt Hell; and Riches with all their Vaunting will do them no Good.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Socrates</hi> (that real Martyr for the one God, againſt the vain Polutheiſm of the <hi>Gentiles)</hi> told his Judges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after they had paſſed the Sentence of Death upon him, <hi>I go away to die, but ye to live a little longer, but which will be the better for us God knows.</hi> My Anſwer is alike to this ſcornful Reproof of thoſe that are at eaſe, and the contempt of the Proud concerning this matter: I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved (by the Divine Grace) to go on in this manner of way, Reproach it in as pitiful and mean a manner as you will; and ye will continue a little longer in your <hi>Contempt of Gods Word and Commandment,</hi> in your going on accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the faſhion and courſe of this World, and in the way of the Multitude; but which will be better for us at laſt, God knows. But the ſame Word of God, which ſpeaks not one Tittle of Good of this kind of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manner of Acting, doth make known to me, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151375:19"/> as long as I continue faithful in his Service, and am <hi>not weary of well-doing, for in due Seaſon, we ſhall reap if we faint not:</hi> If I <hi>fear not the Reproach of Men, nor am afraid of their Revilings:</hi> Then the ſame God who choſe <hi>David</hi> before <hi>Michals</hi> Father, and before all his Houſe, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him Ruler over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the People of the Lord; he alſo may chooſe me to reign in his Kingdom before ſuch Scoffers and Reproachers of me, only for ſerving God in the Word of his Miniſtry; and of the Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, I may be had in Honour, in the day of Eternity, when ſuch like ſhall be thruſt down into ſhame and everlaſting Contempt, and become an hiſſing to Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>In a word, Let People do ſo in all the ſeveral things pertaining to God, as they will wiſh they had done when they come to be Sick unto Death, or in a dying Day; or as ſoon as they are let ſlip into Eternity. Remember this great End, and thou ſhalt never do amiſs.</p>

                  <bibl>Iſaiah XXXVIII. 2, 3.</bibl>
                  <p>Then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> turned his Face toward the Wall and Prayed unto the Lord; And ſaid, Remember now O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a Perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wept ſore.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is not a Sentence or Word in Scripture, but what is obſervable, and ſomewhat may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from thence: Yea, the very Iota's, Points and Stops thereof, are to be heeded and attended unto; for ſome meaning and ſignification may be alſo drawn and conceived of, according as they are and do ſtand: And ſo when we here Read, that <hi>Hezekiah turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Face towards the Wall, and Prayed unto the Lord,</hi> ſome Uſe and Word of Inſtruction is hereby conveyed and made known unto us, namely, that in our Worſhip of the Inviſible God, whether it be Publick or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, we ſhould <hi>turn our Face to the Wall,</hi> that is, as ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Turn away mine Eyes from beholding Vanity, and quicken me in thy way,</hi> Pſal. 139. 37. This we ſhould do at all Times, and in all Places, but yet more eſpecially in and amidſt the Worſhip of God, we ſhould turn away our Eyes from ſo much as beholding other Men
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151375:20"/> and Women; not looking about (as the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is) at every one that comes into the Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: Nor yet ſhould we ſtare about on this ſide or that ſide, to obſerve other Peoples Devotions, to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our own. Nor yet ſhould we look about what Veſtments, Clothes or Apparel ſuch an one, or ſuch an one is in. In a word, we ſhould turn away our Face from all outward and other Objects unto the Wall; which being the ſame ſtill, and there being no great variety therein, will not diſtract the Mind, nor yet much divert it from its being more intent and fixed on its proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeen God;</hi> whom we there come to bow down before, and worſhip in our Soul. <hi>And this I ſpeak for your own Profit, and that you may attend unto the Lord without Diſtraction,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 35. It is the manner of ſome, to ſhut their Eyes in Prayer, to hinder and prevent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more from Wandring and Diſtraction, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on outward Objects: But Satan who hinders ſtill, can and alſo doth fill the Mind with other Thoughts and inward Phantoſms, that unleſs the Mind be more intent upon him that is Inviſible, and alſo upon Inviſible things, ſtill it will be diſtracted. And ſo it may be on the other Hand, as <hi>Balaam fell into a Trance, but having his Eyes open;</hi> ſo one may altogether as well pray unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen God with his Eyes open, whom his viſible works do yet more put in mind of, eſpecially if we lift up our Eyes <hi>to him that dwelleth in the Heavens,</hi> altogether as well as when they are ſhut, provided always that <hi>we turn our Face to the Wall;</hi> that is, the Eyes of our Underſtanding inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from Viſible to Inviſible things.</p>
            <p>At the firſt hearing of that Meſſage, when <hi>Hezekiah thereupon turned his Face to the Wall,</hi> in probability, he thought that then he was to go out of this World; and ſo he would of his own accord, by turning his Face to the Wall, go out from the World in Thought and Conceit, before his Soul ſhould go out of the Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Like as when News was told them of the Death of <hi>Lazarus, then ſaid</hi> Thomas <hi>which is called</hi> Didymus, <hi>unto his Fellow Diſciples, Let us alſo go, that we may dye with him.</hi> And ſo to die and go out of the World in thought, before we dye and go out of the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ife, becauſe we then lived in a Community and Society, and had need of one another: But now it is reaſonable, (which indeed we naturally do) to turn from them when we come to die. Nothing of what we have done to pleaſe Men, will then avail or ſtand in ſtead, but what we have done to pleaſe God; and truly it were to be wiſhed that we had turned from them ſooner.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Samuel, Turn again with me; but</hi> Samuel <hi>turned about to go away:</hi> Which was in diſlike. So contrariwiſe <hi>Hezekiah</hi> upon his Sick Bed, did not turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Face towards the Wall, out of any diſlike to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> for here they were both of a Principle, that is, both Godly, but <hi>Saul</hi> was Ungodly. But <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did thus for another Reaſon, namely, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter terminate, direct and offer up his Prayer unto God.

But beſides that, the Righteouſneſs of all the Subjects that ever <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had; And ſo <hi>the Righteouſneſs of all our Fellow-Creatures,</hi> which we have ever known, or heard of, will not avail, ſo as to be imputed to any other. The Knowledge and Senſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might make <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to <hi>turn unto the Wall, when he had received the Meſſage of Death.</hi> And ſo likewiſe it will do as to us, when we come to lye in a like condition: We muſt ſeverally, and every one of us ſtand upon our own Legs, when we come <hi>to ſtand in the latter days on the Earth,</hi> and when <hi>every one of us are to receive for the deeds done in the Body.</hi> What others have done, what is that to thee?

And what they falſely furniſed, that if they had not done it, the <hi>Romans</hi> would have came and taken away their Place and Nation; but by their doing of it, they took the effectual and ready means to bring them in; for thro' their grievous ſin of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt to Death, the <hi>Romans</hi> did at length come and take away their Place and Nation. Which God might have kept and reſtrained from them, had they not thus grievouſly offended him in killing his Son; Whereupon he made good his Word, <hi>As to ſlay thoſe Wicked Men and let out his Vineyard unto others,</hi> Mark 12. 9. To commit ſin, and then to be willing to avoid the Puniſhment, is to endeavour to put a ſunder what God hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which is impoſſible: for our Gracious God, in that he might the more de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that if People commit the one, they muſt of unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequent have the other, although in thought and deſire they would fain let alone and eſcape it. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never be too hard for God; and where he hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151375:22"/> committed ſin, or done things worthy of Puniſhment, he cannot by any Trick or Artifice avoid the ſeverity of his Vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Like as</hi> Amnon <hi>hated his Siſter</hi> Thamar, <hi>after he had committed Incest and Folly with her; And as the Ten Horns which thou ſaweſt ſhall hate the Whore:</hi> So it is uſual for ſinners upon their Death Beds to hate their Whores, their Drunken Companions and ſuch like, with whom they have been Partakers in any Sin or Iniquity. For the Guilt thereof doth then more appear forth, and they are going away to receive for their Evil Deeds: The foreknowledge whereof doth raiſe this Evil Affection of Hatred, Diſlike and Antipathy. So that even upon that Account, there is an Actual Inclination upon our Death Bed, to turn away our Face from our Fellow Creatures, who are to ſurvive a little longer.</p>
            <p>Moreover a full and through knowledge doth then ariſe in us, that they are not able then to give us any Actual help or relief, now our Breath is a going forth. <hi>Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no help,</hi> Pſal. 146. 3. In the Margent it is ſalvation, which ſignifies ſafety or preſervation. Upon a through Knowledge and Conſideration hereof it appears, that there is little or no help in them even in the midſt of our Life, and yet there is much leſs in that moment wherein we come to dye. If we have done never ſo much to pleaſe Men, it ſignifies nothing in the Hour of Death: They are under the ſame Law and Liableneſs to Death, and they cannot deliver themſelves: So that beſides the Evil and Guilt, and Sins of Omiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But then they will find, that this which was formerly ſo light in their Opinion, will ſink them down to the lowermoſt Hell. That it will be as a <hi>Talent of lead, which is Wickedneſs;</hi> Which will preſs down the Souls of thoſe that are Loaded and Encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed therewith into the lowermoſt parts of the Earth, the Land of Darkneſs and of the ſhadow of Death, where no Light is of Comfort or Freedom from miſery.</p>

For this will be but ſo much the more Torment, when they are ſlipped and paſſed away finally and eternally, and they are in that place where they <hi>want a drop of Water to Cool their Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even we know Experimentally by our ſelves, that when we are now in any Pain or Miſery, the Remembrance of what Pleaſures of Life we have formerly had, or what good things we have heretofore enjoyed, will not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter one Drachm of preſent comfort; Nay, contrariwiſe, It is an Enhancement of the preſent miſery. <hi>How much ſhe hath Glorified her ſelf and lived Deliciouſly, ſo much Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Sorrow give her,</hi> Rev. 18. 7. So it will be meted out, Adjuſted and Proportioned in the future State of the Reſtitution and Diſtribution of all things. How much Pleaſure any one hath had hereon Earth, the leſs He will have after he is removed and gone off from it, yea, <hi>There will be ſo much Torment and Sorrow given to the Perſon that had it.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:151375:26"/> This is an unanſwerable Argument and Terrible conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>Living in Pleaſure on the Earth, or being wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton therein, or Nouriſhing their Hearts as in the Day of Slaughter.</hi> And it ſhould make us to equally fear to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Pleaſure, however Agreeable or Grateful it may now ſeem to Fleſh and Blood, as we would be to take a Snake or Adder into our Boſom; for altho it may ſeem ſmooth or tickle, yet at the laſt it may ſting us unto Death. Or, as we would be to ſuck in the <hi>Cruel Venim of Aſps.</hi> For ſo ſtands the Caſe with Poor Mankind, that their <hi>Wine is mingled with Gall,</hi> and the <hi>Cluſters</hi> out of which it is made are <hi>bitter.</hi> For ſo it ſtands in the Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of things, as they are decreed and appointed by God, <hi>That for faring ſumptuouſly every Day,</hi> they muſt come to the place after theſe Days of their Fleſh are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where they ſhall be <hi>Tormented;</hi> for ſo much Pleaſures of Life and Delicacies they have had here, after Death they muſt have ſo much Torment and Sorrow.</p>
            <p>This again is a moſt clear and convincing Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That the living in the Pleaſures of ſin for a Seaſon,</hi> or the Catching after and enjoying the Delicacies and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, is not a walking before God in Truth, for the end of any ones living in Pleaſure or Delicacy, is in order to be an Happy Men. But now it is impoſſible from the order of the things of God, that either the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a Seaſon,</hi> or the tranſitory delights of the World, ſhould give unto any Man the true Happineſs, becauſe they have ſuch bitter and miſerable conſequents, no more then a Cup of ſweet Poyſon, can tend to the well Being and Health of the Body. So that it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by neceſſary conſequence, that whoſoever follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pleaſures of ſin for a Seaſon, or the delights of the World, altho he now <hi>Bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of mine Heart, to add Drunkenneſs to Thirſt,</hi> Deut. 29. 19. Altho' they hug themſelves in their own Conceit, I ſhall have Happineſs, becauſe that I enjoy ſo many Pleaſures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in Order to it; Yet ſtill herein they do not walk before God in Truth. For they do not go in the right Road to Happineſs, but they are miſtaken and deceived in heart, and they are in a falſe Path, as the end will prove;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151375:26"/> for it will at laſt let them down into the Chambers of Death, the place of Puniſhment and Miſery.</p>
            <p>We may thus know and conclude, that as God gave us a Being at firſt, ſo it is Natural and Reaſonable to expect only from him an happy Being. <hi>My Soul wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him,</hi> Pſal. 62. 5. And thereupon we ſhould walk before him in expectation, and ſeeking after it. And here if we go the right way <hi>(And He led them forth by the right way,</hi> Pſal. 107. 7. There is a great deal in that) which is Chalked and Pointed out, Butted and Bounded in his written word, as long as we make that our Guide and Rule, then indeed we walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in Truth. But as ſure as that word is Truth, <hi>Thy Word is Truth,</hi> the Pleaſures of ſin for a Seaſon, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eagerly they are ſought after and followed by the People of the world; for Satan who deceiveth the whole world makes uſe of this as the great Bait to beguile and catch Souls unto himſelf) are not the true way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bleſſedneſs in the End. <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſted in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. So in like manner it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſoned, that which may be known of God, touching his future diſtribution of things is already manifeſt in Men, for God hath ſhewed it unto them. And accordingly may be obſerved, that Melancholly and Heavineſs of heart (in the midſt of Laughter the heart is ſorrowful) which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at, or after having the Pleaſures of this Life. That Regret of Mind and Vexation of Spirit immediately enſuing upon the Pleaſures of ſin for a Seaſon: All this and the like, is but a manifeſtation before hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſo again it is on the other good hand, Where is Approbation of Mind, the ſatisfaction of a good Conſcience, a Joyful Hope and Comfortable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, as all theſe and the like are annexed to our having our Evil things here, to our enduring labour and taking Pains in the Obedience and Service of God, this is an earneſt of the Spirit and a Manifeſtation in Men, whereby
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151375:27"/> God hath ſhewn unto them that <hi>Glory, Honour and Peace, which ſhall be to every Man that worketh good,</hi> Rom. 2. 10. And that aſſured future bleſſedneſs, which ſhall be to every one that hath lived and done according to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou therefore endure Hardſhip as a Good Souldier of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> VVhich is a Leſſon of Inſtruction to be put in Practice by all faithful Chriſtians, for as we are in the way of Duty and Service of God, the more denial of our ſelves we have uſed as to preſent eaſe and ſafety, the greater ſatisfaction and enjoyment we ſhall have hereafter; whereof now we have a little glimpſe earneſt, aſſurance and foretaſt by that Complacency of mind and lively hope, we may ſometimes perceive after ſuch and ſuch Acts of Duty. Notwithſtanding, the ſame do expoſe us to preſent worldly Inconveniencies, Loſs and Trouble. However we are contented and ſatisfied, and Joyful; for it is ſomething for God. And ſo the more Labour we have been at, the more Reſt we ſhall have hereafter; and this ſame Reſt will be found yet ſo much the more pleaſant. <hi>And He ſaw the Land that it was good, and Reſt that it was Pleaſant,</hi> Gen. 49. 15. Which will be yet more ſo, as we may perceive by the Irkſomneſs of its contrary, that is, Reſtleſsneſs. And ſo the more Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have gone through in the world, the Greater will be our Recompence and Crown; The more loſs hath been ſuſtained in his Service, the greater gain will be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was comforted for the Evil things he had in his life time. Yea, in whatever ſeems Evil, Harſh, Uncouth and Irkſome, it will be made up double, yea, more then an hundred fold in the time of the Reſtitution of all things, <hi>When the times of Refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> So that in each thing we take in hand, we ſhould not ſo much regard whither the ſame be Pleaſant or aukward, but whither it be Duty or Sin, whither it be Good or Evil, whither it will tend to our Benefit or Loſs, our Reward or Puniſhment in the laſt Day. And ſo we ſhould either do, or not do the ſame, either abſtain from, or give way unto it.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:151375:27"/>
            <p>Hereby alſo we may ſomewhat conceive of the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil, Miſchief and Danger of Loytering or Idleneſs. For only Juſt to Reſt or Breath a little, and ſo to Labour or Buſineſs again: Otherwiſe there can no Good come poſſibly of it. Nay, it tends to ſo much Loſs to be ſuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ained throughout all Eternity. And it is a <hi>Loſing ſo much of the Things which we have wrought, that they receive not a full Reward,</hi> according as may be apprehended from. 2. John. 8. Which though there is not much Account made of through Ignorance or Unbelief at preſent, yet <hi>in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dayes ye ſhall conſider it perfectly.</hi> And when we come to ſee every Mans Reward Proportioned and adjuſted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his Labour and Work hath been, then what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall miſs and be diſappointed of through Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sloth in the Dayes of their Fleſh, will raiſe bitter Anguiſh and Indignation within themſelves for not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſtedfaſt, Unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; for they were then foretold, but now they will ſee that their Labour would not have been in Vain in the Lord. If they did ſomewhat Work and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therein, yet ſtill they will have Indignation and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that they did not Work and Labour therein, yet more and more. As it is ſuppoſed, that the Pain of Loſs will be More Grievous, Irkſome and Intolerable then the Pain of ſence. So likewiſe this part of the Pain of Loſs will be ſufficiently, afflicting and diſquieting to the Soul, that ſhe will then wiſh that ſhe had not in the leaſt Given way unto Idleneſs. But ſhe ſhould have looked upon it as One of thoſe Devices of Satan, the Enemy, to deprive and hinder her of ſo much Good in the Future Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.

            <p>Another Explication of <hi>walking before the Lord in Truth,</hi> is, to walk in ſuch a way as is Butted and Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his word, which is Truth. This ſeems to be the moſt proper Acceptation and Underſtanding thereof, for to make Gods written Word and Revelation our Guide and Rule throughout the whole Courſe of our Life, is a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Lord in Truth, and it is the true and right way to Heaven, as to go through or by ſuch and ſuch places, is the way to ſuch a City or the like. The Word and Truth of God are near one and the ſame thing. <hi>Sanctify them through thy Truth, Thy word is Truth,</hi> John 17. 17. And ſo the walking according to the Word of God, or the having our Converſation according to the Goſpel, is to walk before God in Truth. And ſo it is reciprocally, To walk before the Lord in Truth, is to walk according to the VVord of God: Every Variation, or Deviation from it is a falſe way. <hi>Therefore I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be Right, and I hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very falſe way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was both a Puzzling and alſo a ſudden Queſtion of Pilate, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> To me it ſeems to be the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forth the Nature of things as they are, with the Connexion between themſelves and how they pertain to us Men. Things again are divided into things preſent and things to come. Now to know the very Nature of both theſe, and how they belong unto, and are to be had by us, What is Good for us, and what is Evil for us, ſo as to chooſe the Good and Refuſe the Evil, this is Truth. Here again, to make a Right Judgment and Choice for our ſelves, ſo as to purſue the beſt of Ends <hi>(viz.</hi> Future Bleſſedneſs and Glory) by Lawful and Right means, <hi>This a walking before the Lord in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo it may be conceived of in other like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>As to the Second Particular, <hi>What it is to walk before the Lord with a perfect heart. Paul</hi> gives the Character of ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> that they had a <hi>Good mind towards God.</hi> And here, Put and Conceive this together along with that, a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151375:34"/> good mind towards God, and to walk before him with a perfect Heart, do contain the Sum and Excellency, and Attainment of all Religion, ſo as to make it accepted with God; for what would God have more of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then that they ſhould have a good mind towards him, and walk before him with a Perfect Heart?</p>
            <p>Before we ſhew what this laſt is, it may be obſerved, how that as it is written, <hi>The Eyes of all wait upon thee.</hi> So the thoughts of all Men and VVomen, altho' many of them are cumbred about many things pertaining to this Life, and tho' too many do forget God; yet ſtill the Thoughts of every one of them more or leſs, are towards their Inviſible Creatour. Namely, That it is with them in this preſent State, according as he orders and diſpoſes. But eſpecially the great thought and ſearching of heart is, what he will do to them in the future State. Saith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I Remembred God and was troubled; I complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and my Spirit was over-whelmed.</hi> Even ſo, all other things we could bear, for they are little and ſoon paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: But as God was the Creatour of our whole Being at firſt; ſo upon him doth depend our whole future Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (thence doth ariſe up great thought and ſearching of Heart) VVither the ſame ſhall be Happy or Miſerable, Good or Evil unto us. And many times from the fear and apprehenſion, that it will be evil and miſerable to the Creature, as to Futurity, thence doth ariſe Enmity and Hatred towards their Creator. <hi>And you that were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Alienated and Enemies through wicked works, yet now hath he Reconciled,</hi> Col. 1. 21. And ſo according as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been ſinners or ſinful, ſo Proportionably their Minds are Evil, or Evil affected towards God, out of a ſlaviſh fear and dread, leaſt he ſhould in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Yet God is now better pleaſed with ſuch an one, and he ſhall be ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaved hereafter, then if another ſhould like <hi>Anna, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from the Temple, and ſerve God with Faſtings and Prayers. Night and Day,</hi> Luke 2. 37. Or be continually Reading in the Bible, and do all this out of a ſlaviſh Mercenary Principle of ſaving the Soul; but all the ſame while they have not a good mind towards God, nor walk before him with a perfect heart, as there have been many ſuch outward Worſhippers and meer Devotioniſts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and our National Church. <hi>To do Judgment and Juſtice is more Acceptable unto the Lord then Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To walk before God with a Perfect heart,</hi> denotes and requires, That it be whole and compleat, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be wanting. And ſo when we Read often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>of ſerving or ſeeking the Lord with all their Heart, or with their whole Heart.</hi> As again on the other ſide, Many are Reproved, and found Fault with, Becauſe <hi>their Heart was not whole with God, nor continued they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant;</hi> This is the ſame in ſignification with that <hi>of walking before the Lord with a Perfect Heart.</hi> VVe Read often in the Books of <hi>Samuel, Kings</hi> and the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:151375:35"/> where the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem is recorded,</hi> That Character is given of ſome, <hi>That they did follow and cleave unto the Lord with their whole Heart, but moſt did not.</hi> But there was ſome Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Reſerve, wherein <hi>Part of their Heart did go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Idols, or their own Imaginations.</hi> So is the caſe with the common ſort of People. Each of us have a Good Obedient heart towards God in ſome Things, but not in all Things, and ſo it is not a Perfect heart: For that is Perfect to which Nothing is Wanting, but in the hearts of ſuch is Wanting alike Obedience to the Law of God in other Things, as what they do Render and Yield. And ſo it is as to the Word of God, The heart of People doth Love and relliſh the Word of God in ſome Things, but not in all Things; for according as either People have kept or Tranſgreſſed againſt it, ſo they either like or conceive an Enmity, or a Riſing and Rebellion in their hearts againſt it. The Drunkard or Sottiſh Perſon doth not Really and Inwardly Love all thoſe Texts of Scripture, which make againſt that ſin, or which Threaten a W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Miſery to come to thoſe who follow it. So it is with the Unrighteous or Unclean Perſon, They have ſecret inward rancour and Indignation againſt that Part of the Word of God, which finds out and ſpeaks againſt their ſeveral and Particular ſins. We may hereby ſomewhat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what exceeding Evil there is in ſin. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Three Shepherds alſo I cut off in one Month, and my Soul lothed them, and their Soul alſo abhorred me.</hi> Zech. 11. 18. This was their ſin and fault. So the caſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between God and the ſinner, The Soul of God lotheth the ſinner, and the Soul of the ſinner alſo abhorreth God. This ſhould be a prevailing conſideration for every one to ſtand in Aw and ſin not: Becauſe that Each Act of Adviſed, Deliberate and continued ſin carries and contains in it a lothing and abhorring of God himſelf. As again God lothes his own Creature, the Work of his own hands, as he ſees ſin in them. This Lothing and abhorring either of the Creatour towards the Creature, or of the Creature towards the Creatour, is as directly oppoſite and contrary to the having a Good mind towards God, as Darkneſs is unto Light. It is alſo contrary unto a Perfect heart, for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151375:35"/> this is an Imperfection to a Witneſs; Yea ſuch an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that unleſs it be remedied and taken away, it will lay the Creature in Puniſhment and Miſery.</p>
            <p>As for mine own Part, although in my common or week Day Life and converſation, I have ſpoken and done Many Things, which are contrary unto, different from, and not according to the Pure VVord of God; yet I do not therefore dare to Hate or Reproach that ſame Word; Nor yet (for none doth ſo as to the VVord abſtractedly) to the Perſon of him who miniſtreth or ſpeaketh forth the ſame VVord againſt this my Sin and Errour. For I know, this would make the Guilt of my Sin ſeven times yet Greater, and Conſequently Uengeance would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on me ſevenfold when the Lord comes to Puniſh the VVorld for their Evil and the wicked for their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But I Judge it ſafe to lay my Hand upon my Mouth, and hold my Peace; and where I ſee my ſelf faulty to Endeavour to mend. And <hi>where I have not already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, neither am already Perfect.</hi> Phil. 3. 12. There to <hi>Go on to Perfection.</hi> Heb 6. 1. Avoiding the Errour and deceit of the VVorld herein of always Purpoſing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and not performing accordingly; or of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yet not mending: But we ſhould ſtill Preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Undeavour Unfeignedly ſo to do. Not to attain unto abſolute Perfection is the Infirmity of the Fleſh; but not to endeavour after it is the fault and failure of the Spirit. Here again it muſt be acknowledged, that to walk before the Lord with a Perfect Heart, is ſooner ſaid then done. For it is the whole which God requires of Man, It being the firſt and Great Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God, With all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength and with all thy Mind.</hi> This Particle, <hi>All,</hi> being Annexed to all the Faculties and Powers thereof, makes it a Perfect Heart: For ſo it is, where is all, or the whole of a Thing.</p>
            <p>Beſides this Appeal which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> makes unto God in his Pining Sickneſs not by way of ſelf Commendation, but as a ſtay and ſupport to his Mind under that outward Evil of Body, The Spirit it ſelf gives a very Good Character of him, <hi>And he did that which was Right in the ſight of the Lord according to all that David his Father did. He truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151375:36"/> in the Lord God of Iſrael, ſo that after him was none like him, among all the Kings of Judah, nor any that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi> 2. Kings. 18. 3, 5. So that his doing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that <hi>David</hi> his Father did (who was a Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods one heart in all Things ſaving the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah the Hittite)</hi> Thus in reality and in Truth <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah did walk before the Lord with a perfect Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this alſo may be ſeen that the Spirit of God keeps a Regiſter of each Man or VVomans Life. And God who is no Reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteonſneſs is accepted with him; <hi>Who accepteth not the Perſon of Princes, nor regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Rich more then the Poor, for they are all the Work of his hands,</hi> doth in alike manner keep a Book <hi>(Put thou my Tears into thy Bottle, are not theſe things noted in thy Book?)</hi> Wherein the ſeveral deeds here done in the Body of all the Particular Men and Women of all Generations and Countreys, from the greateſt of them unto the leaſt of them, are written and noted all one, as we ſee it written thus and thus, of the ſeveral Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> how they did carry it towards the Lord God; for ſo we may read it thus or thus, recorded of the Inhabitants of the Earth in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
            <p>There is an Emphatical and Pertinent Scripture to our preſent purpoſe, in <hi>Hoſ. 10. 2. Their heart is divided, now they ſhall be found faulty.</hi> A divided heart is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart; and as long as it remains thus divided we hence ſee, that it will be found and pronounced faulty, that is defective or wanting in the ſight, Eſtimation, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Account of God. And yet alas! Is not this the caſe of us all, or of moſt of us, Is not our heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, one part is towards God, and another part is for the World, and for the Men and Things therein? Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf, <hi>So then with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with the fleſh the Law of ſin,</hi> Rom. 7. 25. He that doth not obſerve and feel the like within himſelf, is Blind, Ignorant and knows nothing as he ought to know. Doth not one part of our heart Savour the things of God? And again, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of our heart doth Savour the Things of Men. I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151375:36"/> diſcern and experience it ſo in my ſelf. Now this is but a <hi>divided heart,</hi> which God in <hi>Hoſea</hi> finds fault with. And when he ſaith in the <hi>Proverbs, My Son give me thine heart,</hi> It may be truly reaſoned and concluded, that he will have a whole heart or none. And hereupon the word of Inſtruction and Exhortation ariſes on this wiſe, that this ſame <hi>divided heart</hi> muſt be cut off <hi>(Circumciſe therefore the foreskin of your hearts, that ye be no more ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked)</hi> or rather changed and renewed, that all the heart may be brought into intire obedience, Subjection and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God, till it becomes a good and perfect heart which He is well pleaſed with and delights in and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept off, for want whereof it is, that we neither find God, nor yet doth he hear our Prayers.

So that where we cry and the Lord doth not hear, or where we do not find ſuch an Anſwer and Return to Prayer as we have experienced heretofore, there let us examine our ſelves, whither there be not ſome Sin or Iniquity (which is the Cloud that hinders, that our Prayers do not paſs through) in us, which God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with.

            <p>THAT we do walk all our Days in the ſight of the Lord, and whatever we do it is in the ſight of the Lord, and how that God will Judge us for all the Thoughts, Words and Actions of our whole Life, even from the very time that we had the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil, are moſt forcible conſiderations, what manner of Perſons we ought to be in all Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſs, in all Obedience and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, In Purity and Innocency, and Uprightneſs of Life. In all thy work and in whatever thine hand findeth thee to do, in thy Feaſtings, Sportings, or Recreations, Do thou awfully and conſtantly Remember that God ſeeth thee and God will Judge thee. And after any thing is over and paſt, whither it be an Act of Good and Duty, or elſe an Act of Sin or Evil, This know that the ſame is paſſed over into a thing to be Judged off; and for the

O that we could once have a lively, true and through ſenſe, how that we Live and Act all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the ſight of the unſeen God; whom tho' we do not ſee, yet He ſeeth us. And then we ſhould be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to pleaſe and approve our ſelves unto him in all things, as ever any Servant was to his Maſter, any Maiden to her Miſtreſs, or as any Poor Perſon is to his Rich and Bountiful Benefactor, or as we ſtudy to pleaſe thoſe whom we moſt Love and are moſt beholden unto.

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:151375:41"/> to our ſelves, Namely, That we ſhould ſo live every Day as we will averr and juſtify, and ſtand by the ſame at the Bar of God, and as we will Anſwer for it at his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat. For if we are reſolved and purpoſed on this wiſe, then we ſhould do nothing but what is Lawful and Right; For when God enters into Judgment, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is ſo, <hi>ſhall be juſtified in his ſight.</hi> And whether we are of that foregoing Purpoſe and Reſolution of mind or not, yet ſtill we muſt unavoidably give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and be Judged for the ſeveral deeds done in the Body, whether they be Good or Evil. We muſt be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as certain as that we muſt die, which again is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as that we now live.</p>
            <p>This is the difference between the Godly and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Wicked, Ungodly, or Ignorant People of the World; The former part ſo live, as thinking and knowing before hand that they muſt be judged; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are for preparing and making up their Account before hand, They are for doing all things that they may ſtand in that Day, and they do intreat their Judge in the mean while for his Favour, Acceptation and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Acquital againſt the Great Day of Everlaſting Deciſion. But the Wicked, Ungodly and Ignorant do live at Random, and in Forgetfullneſs, or Unmindfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the future Judgment; They being reſolved on their way <hi>(I have loved ſtrangers and after them I will go)</hi> They do things at a venture, and they run the riſque of the future Judgment; and ſo they are in danger to be <hi>broken, ſnared</hi> and <hi>taken,</hi> to fall and be Condemned in that Day. In a word, Let People do whatever they will in the mean time, yet the Great Day of Judgment will ſurely come and will not tarry one moment longer beyond the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Time. This we are now warned of again before hand, that when it ſhall come we may have the leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or Plea, that of this and of every Day of our Life after Years of Diſcretion, we are not only in danger, but we ſhall be certainly called to an Account.</p>
            <p>As the Wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>Remember the End and thou ſhalt never do amiſs.</hi> So it may be applied and reaſoned a little further, keep the Judgment of God always in thine Eye, and thou ſhalt never go much aſtray.</p>

But <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> weeping ſore, or great weeping was not for this Reaſon, for his Life was <hi>True, Perfect</hi> and <hi>Good; So that after him, none was like unto him among all the Kings of</hi> Judah. And God that cannot lie, hath now under the Goſpel promiſed <hi>Eternal Life to the patient continuance in well doing,</hi> Rom. 2. 7. But probably <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not know of this, as the Saints and Servants of God of latter Ages do. And then like one who is turned and diſpoſſeſſed out of a Cottage, may at firſt take it in Indignation and Vexation, when He then knows not that it is in order to be removed into a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> then not knowing, that if He ſhould be taken out of his Earthly Pallace, that He ſhould be received up into Heaven the City of the Great King which would be much better, He might probably think it Irkſome and a Loſs to be taken from the other.

                  </gap> and the ſame thing. So beſides the Reaſons afore-alledged, I do aſſuredly gather from other Places of Scripture, This was the Principal Reaſon why <hi>Hezekiah</hi> wept ſore, Namely, Through the abundance of Comfort, which upon Reflexion of his foregoing well ſpent Life, did thereupon flow and ſtream into his Soul. For ſuch a True, Perfect and Good foregoing Life, (as ſure as the Scriptures are true.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:151375:47"/> 
                  <hi>And the Work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, and the effect of Righteouſneſs, Quietneſs and Aſſurance for ever,</hi> Iſa. 32. 17.) Muſt neceſſarily yield unto <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Conſolation, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. It is manifeſt that He did not weep ſore, out of any Vexation or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that He had led ſo Good a Life. In no wiſe. But rather at that very Inſtant, Joy did ſpring up unto him out of thoſe <hi>Wells of Salvation,</hi> which if He had then died, He had went away to have more fully taſted on.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon which cauſed him to weep ſore may hence proceed, even from his Great Earneſtneſs He had then with God; for in what Prayer He then made and directed unto him, He was very earneſt and real therein, which made him to guſh forth into Tears and Weeping. This is a frequent and common thing with the Saints and Servants of God, that when they are extraordinary and very earneſt indeed with God about any thing, to Weep and Pour forth Tears before him, as we may Read ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Examples hereof in Scripture. I ſhall inſtance but in one which is very pertinent to the preſent purpoſe, it is Written of <hi>Jacob, That by his ſtrength He had Power with God. Yea, He had Power over the Angel and Prevailed.</hi> (How all this was done and effected, it may be ſeen by what is Immediately added further) <hi>He wept and made Supplication,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 3, 4. And herein <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhewed himſelf to be a true Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> an Iſraelite indeed, for as appears from the Verſes following my Text, He alſo got hereby Acceptation and Audience from God, <hi>Go and ſay unto</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord the God of</hi> David <hi>thy Father, I have heard thy Prayer, I have ſeen thy Tears.</hi> So that He had ſome fruit and effect of his weeping ſore, even all that He would have and deſire for the Lord to grant his Requeſt. It is very acceptable with God, and commonly gains the point when his Servants do weep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in Prayer: Provided it be done, not in Hypocriſie, Diſſimulation, pretence and outward ſhew; but when it really ariſes from a broken and contrite Spirit <hi>(The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of God are a broken Spirit, a broken and contrite Heart, O God thou wilt not deſpiſe)</hi> From a troubled Soul, and when it is under Great Earneſtneſs, either to be

               <p>The other Uſe which I ſhall draw and infer from theſe laſt words of our Text, <hi>And Hezekiah wept ſore,</hi> ſhall be, To Recommend unto thoſe who are in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Truth obedient Servants of the Lord, to be in a State of Weeping and Mourning. Say I theſe things as a Man? For doth not the Law of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Recommend and ſay the very ſame unto ye? <hi>Therefore alſo now ſaith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your Heart and with Faſting</hi> (the intent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to <hi>afflict our Soul,</hi> Iſa. 58. 3.) <hi>And with Weeping and with Mourning. Let the Bridegroom go forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet. Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, Weep between the Porch and the Altar; and let them ſay, Spare thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach,</hi> Joel. 2. 12, 13, 14, 17. <hi>And in that Day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to Weeping and to Mourning, and to Girding with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ack-cloth.</hi> (Little of this is obeyed and obſerved in this Generation and Countrey of ours, but herein is fulfilled what is next Written) <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Joy and Gladneſs, ſlaying oxen and killing ſheep, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fleſh and Drinking Wine: Let us Eat and Drink for to Morrow we ſhall die. And it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of Hoſts, ſurely this Iniquity ſhall not be Purged from ye, until ye die ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 22. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>But here it may be ſurmiſed and ſaid, That ſuch kind of harſh and ſowre Doctrine may be Reaſonably expected from the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, which came from Mount <hi>Sinah which gendreth Bondage,</hi> from whence the Law was given in Fire, in Blackneſs and Darkneſs, and Tempeſt of Thunder and Lightning. But the Goſpel was not uſhered nor brought into the World after that manner, for it came in a ſtill Voice, with a <hi>Fear not, for behold I bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy which ſhall be to all People,</hi> Luke 2. 10. Doth this ſame Goſpel Recommend, or ſay any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151375:50"/> this State of Weeping and Mourning? For if it ſhould, How would it then bring us Good Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Great Joy, which ſhall be unto all People? Yes, aſſuredly it doth both; but herein is Compriſed the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> That the Weeping and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt go before the Joy, which is to be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us, and had by us. Saith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who ſpake by a true Goſpel Spirit, <hi>Be Afflicted, and Mourn and Weep: Let your Laughter be turned to Mourning, and your Joy to Heavineſs. Humble your ſelves in the ſight of God, and He ſhall lift you up,</hi> James 4. 9, 10. And then by conſequence if we do all this, <hi>The Lord who ſhall turn our Captivity as the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the South,</hi> will again turn our Mourning to Laughter, and our Heavineſs to Joy. According as is promiſed by his Spirit, which ſpake through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Prophet, <hi>And the Ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to</hi> Zion <hi>with Songs; They ſhall obtain Joy and Gladneſs, and Sorrow and Sighing ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> Iſa. 35. 10. Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, (in whom all the Goſpel doth center) doth aſſure and promiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the ſame in thoſe afore-quoted words of his, wherein alſo He doth Recommend to all that are Chriſtians indeed, this State of Weeping now, with that true Word of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>for ye ſhall Laugh.</hi> As alſo He tacitly finds fault with, and threatens where People Laugh now, <hi>for they ſhall Mourn and Weep.</hi> So that the way to Happineſs hereafter, is, by Mourning and Weeping here. As again, Laughter and Merriment now (I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak here of the Laughter and Merriment of the World, which ariſes from the things thereof) is the way to miſery hereafter. <hi>Behold, in this Gods Thoughts are not as Mans Thoughts;</hi> For herein they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Thoughts of the People of the World, who if they ſee any one to ſerious and Godly, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they conclude him to be Melancholy and Miſerable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> whereas as ſure as Gods Word is true, this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to the true Bleſſedneſs. But contrariwiſe it is as to the Merry M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n of the World, for in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eſtimation of God, if we take a view o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:151375:50"/> them by the Glaſs of his Word, and go into the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſee the end of theſe Men, <hi>Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery Places, Thou caſtedſt them down into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> Pſal. 73. 18. As the pleaſant and purling ſtreams of <hi>Jordan,</hi> do empty themſelves into the Dead Sea; So all their ſinful Mirth and Laughter will End and Terminate in endleſs Howlings.</p>
               <p>Seeing that theſe things are ſo, What manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought we to be in all Gravity of Spirit and Serious Converſation? Even with the ſame <hi>Hezekiah, Like a Crane or a Swallow, ſo did I chatter, I did Mourn as a Dove,</hi> Iſa. 38. 14. For as to this, the ſweet Word of Promiſe ſpeaks on this wiſe, <hi>And the Days of thy Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhall be ended,</hi> Iſa. 60. 20. Which again (according as our Mourning hath been) will be made up in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Cup of Conſolation and Rejoycing. And tho' as afore-obſerved of ſome Conſtitutions, that they cannot Weep, or ſhed Tears: So here it may be, when People are in Health, Wealth and Proſperity, when they have the World at will, as we commonly Phraſe and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and all things are ſmooth and eaſy with them, <hi>When their Eyes ſtand out with Fatneſs, they have more then heart could wiſh,</hi> Pſal. 73. 7. When they are Puffed up with ſenſuality and the Good Things of this Life, then indeed they cannot ſo eaſily be in a State of Weeping and Mourning. But here again, as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Old Time, that they ſhould not come near their Wives, when they were in their ſolemn times of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching and drawing near unto the Lord God. And as now under the Goſpel, the Apoſtle delivereth the Rule unto Husbands and Wives, <hi>Defraud ye not one the other except it be with conſent for a Time, that ye may give your ſelves unto Faſting and Prayer.</hi> So in like manner it may be Reaſoned and Inferred, That we ſhould ſometimes abridge and deny our ſelves, even the Lawful Comforts and Enjoyments of Life, that we may the more afflict our Souls, and ſo come to be in a due Poſture and Frame, for a State of Weeping and Mourning.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And without all doubt it fared the better with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> here, for the Godlineſs of <hi>David</hi> his Grand-Father or more Properly his Forefather, for there were more than three Generations or Deſcents between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> We read Several Times in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, that a Bleſſing was entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Poſterity for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake; and where ſome of his Children or rather deſcendants did not walk in Gods Covenant, nor keep his Statutes, nevertheleſs God would not cut them off quite nor deſtroy them utterly, Becauſe of the Loving Kindneſs and Mercy, which he ſtill retained unto <hi>David</hi> their Forefather; as there are Sundry Expreſſions to this purpoſe in the Scripture. Beſides that there was ſomewhat in <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> himſelf which God liked and was well pleaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Yet he liked him ſo much the better and was more pleaſed with him becauſe of <hi>David</hi> his Father. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears here by ſtiling himſelf the <hi>God of David his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> When he acquaints <hi>Hezekiah</hi> of hearing his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that he would do ſuch a Good Thing for him. There is not a Word in Scripture but what is Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſomewhat may be gathered and drawn from thence of the Mind of God. Hereby may be ſeen that God had a kindneſs and Favour unto the Houſe and Family of <hi>David,</hi> as indeed he had to that and to the Family and Houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob</hi> or <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There are more Good Things ſaid throughout the Book of the Lord of them, than of all the Families of the Earth beſides. But therefore chiefly it was, becauſe of what was aforeſaid to <hi>Abraham, In thy ſeed ſhall all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth be Bleſſed,</hi> and of this Mans ſeed, and ſo of <hi>Jacob</hi> and of <hi>Davids</hi> ſeed (To ſhew which the Genealogy of him is ſo Particularly reckoned up in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Mathew)</hi> according to the Fleſh, God would raiſe up his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Diverſity may be now obſerved under the Goſpel, that, unleſs when it is Quoted out of the Old Teſtament, he is never called the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151375:55"/> of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> nor yet the God of <hi>David,</hi> but there he is ſtiled and Named the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according as ſo <hi>Paul</hi> calls him by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>As our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt argues to the Jews, <hi>If ye were the Children of, Abraham ye would do the Works of Abraham,</hi> ſo here in like manner it may be Reaſoned, that if the Lord was the God of <hi>David</hi> thy Father, ſo he would be the God of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> alſo one of his Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y; Provided always, and as long as he did the works of <hi>David</hi> his Fore-father. And as God did preſerve <hi>David,</hi> from many Perils and Dangers, ſo the ſame God would preſerve <hi>Hezekiah</hi> alſo from the Danger of Pining Sickneſs, and give him as it were a new Life and Health ſpringing from out of it as the day doth ſucceed the Darkneſs of Night. Where God ſaith a Thing, he doth always perform the ſame, which accordingly he did make Good and fulfil unto the ſame <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as appears by the Hiſtory thereof as it ſtands recorded in Several Places of the Bible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have heard thy Prayer, I have ſeen thy Tears.</hi> As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods hearing our Prayes, the ſum of that matter is, <hi>That God will be Sanctified by all them that draw near unto him.</hi> The Worſhipper is not to Regard Iniquity in his Heart, but to call upon the Lord with his whole heart and then the Lord will hear our Prayer and be found by us. <hi>Be ye clean that bear the Veſſels of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 52. 11. And ſo it is requiſite to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit in order that our Prayers may aſcend up, and be accepted with and Granted by the moſt high God. Therefore it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had walked before God in Truth <hi>(For the Lord is nigh unto all that call upon him in Truth)</hi> and with a Perfect Heart which is a whole and not a divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart; Therefore it was that the Lord heard his Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have ſeen thy Tears.</hi> It commonly gains the Point or obtains the thing Requeſted for, when the People and Servants of God do ſhed Tears in Prayer; if this be done not in Hypocriſie, or Diſſimulation, but out of great Earneſtneſs and Reality of Soul; the Truth whereof is here fulfilled; for therefore it was that Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Though we do not ſee God, yet we ſee his Works, which we cannot ſo much as look without doors but we behold them. For tis his Heavens which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151375:60"/> annex ſalvation unto it. That is, ſave and bring it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from that Periſhing and Corruption, that Death and Diſſolution which hath already come in part, and is yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come upon the whole Creation of God, Becauſe the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the Glorious liberty of the Children of God.

It ſtands on this wiſe in the order and decree of things, to do them at firſt in a leſſer degree in order to a greater: To carry and advance them from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection to Perfection. <hi>It is ſown in Corruption, It is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Incorruption:</hi> To firſt make them with a Periſhing Nature, and afterwards Graft on and add an Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they are never more to be done away, nor yet to ceaſe to be. <hi>All this cometh from the Lord of Hoſts, which is wonderful in Counſel and Excellent in working.</hi> And all this is as certainly true and will be found ſo in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, as God is God; which again, is as certain as that there is a world and any thing in it; for he is the Maker of all things and by whom they ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then</hi> Philip <hi>opened his Mouth, and began at the ſame Scripture and Preached unto him Jeſus.</hi> So if one was to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151375:61"/> begin at this ſame Scripture, Behold, I will add unto thy Days Fifteen Years, and from thence Preach unto you E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, (which God that cannot lye promiſed before the World began (for diſcovery was made thereof by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little unto the Fathers.) <hi>But hath in due times manifeſted his word through Preaching,</hi> Titus 1. 2, 3.) It might at firſt ſeem hard and perplex unto ye, how the Preacher would draw forth and infer Eternal Life from theſe Words; which at firſt ſight and appearance rather ſhews the contrary, that the Life of Man will come to an utter end. And yet it hath been made out in ſome Meaſure. But the Reaſoning and Inference of Eternal Life doth yet further ariſe from that word, <hi>add.</hi> For as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> argues ſomewhat, yea, very much in reference to the caſe in hand, <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the Dead, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So in like manner it may be here reaſoned, if God did add Fifteen Years unto <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi> Life, becauſe he had heard his Prayer and ſeen his Tears, ſo he will add unto him and to all others (who pray and cry for, and ſhall be Judged worthy) that <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which the Lord hath commanded, even Life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 133. 3. The words foregoing are to be taken notice of, <hi>As the Dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the Dew that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon the Mountains of Zion:</hi> Even ſo this <hi>Life for evermore, is to deſcend upon the Reaſonable Inhabitants of this Earth, after they are deſcended into the Bars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ſe his Creatures, as to command his Dew to deſcend down from above. It is as eaſy a matter with Almighty God to Link and Annex on <hi>Life for evermore,</hi> as ſoon as this Life, which is as a Vapour, and continueth not, is ended, as to add Fifteen Years, or any Days, Weeks, Months, or Years, to this Temporal Life, or as it was to hold our Souls in Life thoſe Days which are paſt already, or as it is to give any Life at firſt. All things are equally poſſible to an Almighty Power, and what he hath ſaid, ſhall be fulfilled. And therefore it fitly and properly comes in the middle of that aforequoted Place out of <hi>Titus, In hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the World began,</hi> Titus 1. 2. For indeed it is promiſed throughout all the Old Teſtament, tho' it be moſt commonly ſhaded there in Dark Speeches and General Expreſſions, as <hi>I am
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151375:61"/> the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c. I am thy God.</hi> I commanded them Statutes, which if a Man do, He ſhall even live in them. This of neceſſity muſt be underſtood of future and Eternal Life; for Tranſgreſſors alſo did live this Preſent and Temporal Life. <hi>The Lord, the hope of thy Fathers.</hi> And therefore they muſt remain and be raiſed up again in being tho' dead and gone, or otherwiſe God could not be properly and truly ſtiled their Hope. And ſo this adding of Fifteen Years unto the Days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was an earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and pledge before-hand and alſo a making known and ſhewing unto him in a myſtery, that God would add and annex unto him Life for evermore, when thoſe Fifteen Years of Reprieve ſhould be gone out. In a Word, the difference between the Preaching, manifeſtation and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known of Eternal Life under the Old Teſtament; And that to us now made under the Goſpel, was as the firſt breaking of the Day or Twilight, is now as to the Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more and more unto perfect Day, or as an Hour and an half before Sun riſing, is to its ſhining in its fulleſt and cleareſt Brightneſs. For thoſe of old time, had but juſt a Gueſs and Glimeering thereof; <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life,</hi> John 5. 39. But we know and are aſſured that in them we have Eternal Life; Now Jeſus Chriſt hath Aboliſhed Death and brought Life and Immortality to Light (which before was in the Twilight only) through the Goſpel. <hi>And this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even Eternal Life,</hi> 1 John 2. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Eternity! Eternity! Eternity!</hi> How doſt thou fill and ſwallow up our Thoughts with Terrour and Amazement! To Launch forth into thee (which we unavoidably muſt) ſeems at firſt ſight as dreadful, as for us little Creatures to throw our ſelves into the great and wide Sea, where we are as it were loſt and are as nothing in Compariſon of it. Or, as it ſeems dreadful to ſtand alone upon an exceeding high Pinacle, having no more room than only juſt to ſe t our foot upon with nothing to hold by, but encompaſſed about only with the thin, Vaſt and Spacious Air. Unleſs we have hope, the Anchor of the Soul, which muſt have ſome Ground or Object to fix on. Now the Object of Hope is the Promiſes; and Particularly and in a moſt eminent manner, that great Promiſe which he hath Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, even Eternal Life; Otherwiſe we ſhall be of all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151375:62"/> Men, yea, of all Creatures, moſt miſerable. <hi>For as the Tree Falls, ſo it lies.</hi> As Death leaves us, ſo Judgment find us. As the Soul goes out of the Body, whether ſanctified and renewed, or unſanctified and unrenewed, ſo it remains and ſo it muſt appear in Gods ſight when ſhe ſhall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and is to receive accordingly, There is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing or Altering her Condition in Eternity.
